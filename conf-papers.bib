  comment       = {Outlines using of Hybrid Dynamic Systems for integration of mobility and manipulation. The two systems have different dynamics, and it is thus convenient to seperate the systems and provide loose synchronisation. The mobilty system is controlled using a behaviour based approach. The manipulation control is carried out using HDS. The two systems are coupled using an observer. The full system is implemented using a software framework named Mobile Manipulation Control Architecture (MMCA). The software includes a dedicated language for specification of tasks. The task specification is built around the HDS primitives.},
